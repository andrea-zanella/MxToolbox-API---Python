# MxToolbox-API - Python
Bulk security settings (SPF, DMARC, DKIM) check for the domains in a list

### Quick start

Go to the RESTful API page of MxToolbox (https://mxtoolbox.com/User/Api/Lookup.aspx), find the API key (var apiKey = ...) and copy it into the code (line 8).

Run the python script, you will see the results printed in the console and the non-compliant security settings written in the result txt file.

### Change domain and commands
You can change them editing the txt files domains.txt and commands.txt (you can add or remove lookup commands).
